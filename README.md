# IMDB APP Clone

This GitHub repository contains the source code for an IMDB app clone, developed using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and API integration.

## Project Overview

The IMDB app clone is a web application that mimics the functionality and design of the popular movie and TV show database, IMDB (Internet Movie Database). It allows users to search for movies, view detailed information about them, and add them to your favourite list.

The project utilizes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create the user interface and handle user interactions. 

To fetch movie data, the application integrates with the IMDB API. The API provides access to a vast collection of movies, TV shows, actors, and other related information. By leveraging the API, the clone app retrieves and displays relevant data based on user search queries and interactions.

## Features

The IMDB app clone offers the following features:

1. **Movie Search**: Users can search for movies by entering keywords or specific titles in the search bar. The app dynamically updates the search results as the user types, providing instant feedback.

2. **Movie Details**: Clicking on a movie from the search results displays its detailed information, including the title, release year, rating, plot summary, cast, and other relevant data.

3. **Favorites**: Users can mark movies as favorites and save them for future reference. The app provides an intuitive interface to manage and view the user's favorite movies.
